# Snake-Game
This Snake game is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Tkinter library
for creating the graphical user interface. The player controls a snake that moves around the game board
and tries to eat food to increase its length. The game continues until the snake collides with the wall
or itself.

Features:
- Control the snake's direction with arrow keys (left, right, up, down).
- The snake grows in length when it consumes food.
- The game keeps track of the player's score.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself, displaying a "Game Over" message.
